0.1 - Using This Document
=========================

While creating this document, I took every effort to try to make it easy to
read, as well as easy to find what you're looking for.

In most cases, where a hexadecimal value is given, it is followed by the
equivalent decimal value in parenthesis. For example, "0x200 (512)."


1.0 - About Chip-8
==================

Whenever I mention to someone that I'm writing a Chip-8 interpreter, the
response is always the same: "What's a Chip-8?"

Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used
on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. These
computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had
between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input.
The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were
entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller.

In the early 1990s, the Chip-8 language was revived by a man named Andreas
Gustafsson. He created a Chip-8 interpreter for the HP48 graphing calculator,
called Chip-48. The HP48 was lacking a way to easily make fast games at the
time, and Chip-8 was the answer. Chip-48 later begat Super Chip-48, a
modification of Chip-48 which allowed higher resolution graphics, as well
as other graphical enhancements.

Chip-48 inspired a whole new crop of Chip-8 interpreters for various
platforms, including MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Amiga, HP48, MSX, Adam, and
ColecoVision. I became involved with Chip-8 after stumbling upon Paul
Robson's interpreter on the World Wide Web. Shortly after that, I began
writing my own Chip-8 interpreter.

This document is a compilation of all the different sources of information
I used while programming my interpreter.


2.0 - Chip-8 Specifications
===========================

This section describes the Chip-8 memory, registers, display, keyboard,
and timers.


2.1 - Memory
------------

The Chip-8 language is capable of accessing up to 4KB (4,096 bytes) of RAM,
from location 0x000 (0) to 0xFFF (4095). The first 512 bytes, from 0x000 to
0x1FF, are where the original interpreter was located, and should not be used
by programs.

Most Chip-8 programs start at location 0x200 (512), but some begin at
0x600 (1536). Programs beginning at 0x600 are intended for the ETI 660
computer.

    | Reserved for  |
    |  interpreter  |
    +---------------+= 0x000 (0) Start of Chip-8 RAM


2.2 - Registers
---------------

Chip-8 has 16 general purpose 8-bit registers, usually referred to as Vx,
where x is a hexadecimal digit (0 through F). There is also a 16-bit register
called I. This register is generally used to store memory addresses, so only
the lowest (rightmost) 12 bits are usually used.

The VF register should not be used by any program, as it is used as a flag
by some instructions. See section 3.0, Instructions for details.

Chip-8 also has two special purpose 8-bit registers, for the delay and sound
timers. When these registers are non-zero, they are automatically decremented
at a rate of 60Hz. See the section 2.5, Timers & Sound, for more information
on these.

There are also some "pseudo-registers" which are not accessable from
Chip-8 programs. The program counter (PC) should be 16-bit, and is
used to store the currently executing address. The stack pointer (SP)
can be 8-bit, it is used to point to the topmost level of the stack.

The stack is an array of 16 16-bit values, used to store the address
that the interpreter shoud return to when finished with a subroutine.
Chip-8 allows for up to 16 levels of nested subroutines.


2.3 - Keyboard
--------------

The computers which originally used the Chip-8 Language had a 16-key
hexadecimal keypad with the following layout:

  +---+---+---+---+
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | C |
  +---+---+---+---+
  | 4 | 5 | 6 | D |
  +---+---+---+---+
  | 7 | 8 | 9 | E |
  +---+---+---+---+
  | A | 0 | B | F |
  +---+---+---+---+

This layout must be mapped into various other configurations to fit the
keyboards of today's platforms.


2.4 - Display
-------------

The original implementation of the Chip-8 language used a 64x32-pixel
monochrome display with this format:

    +------------------------------+
    | (0,0)                 (63,0) |
    |                              |
    |                              |
    |                              |
    |                              |
    | (0,31)               (63,31) |
    +------------------------------+

Some other interpreters, most notably the one on the ETI 660, also had
64x48 and 64x64 modes. To my knowledge, no current interpreter supports
these modes. More recently, Super Chip-48, an interpreter for the HP48
calculator, added a 128x64-pixel mode. This mode is now supported by most
of the interpreters on other platforms.

Chip-8 draws graphics on screen through the use of sprites. A sprite is a
group of bytes which are a binary representation of the desired picture.
Chip-8 sprites may be up to 15 bytes, for a possible sprite size of 8x15.

Programs may also refer to a group of sprites representing the hexadecimal
digits 0 through F. These sprites are 5 bytes long, or 8x5 pixels. The data
should be stored in the interpreter area of Chip-8 memory (0x000 to 0x1FF).
Below is a listing of each character's bytes, in binary and hexadecimal:

2.5 - Timers & Sound
--------------------

Chip-8 provides 2 timers, a delay timer and a sound timer.

The delay timer is active whenever the delay timer register (DT) is non-zero.
This timer does nothing more than subtract 1 from the value of DT at a rate
of 60Hz. When DT reaches 0, it deactivates.

The sound timer is active whenever the sound timer register (ST) is non-zero.
This timer also decrements at a rate of 60Hz, however, as long as ST's value
is greater than zero, the Chip-8 buzzer will sound. When ST reaches zero,
the sound timer deactivates.

The sound produced by the Chip-8 interpreter has only one tone. The frequency
of this tone is decided by the author of the interpreter.


3.0 - Chip-8 Instructions
=========================

The original implementation of the Chip-8 language includes 36 different
instructions, including math, graphics, and flow control functions.

Super Chip-48 added an additional 10 instructions, for a total of 46.

All instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored most-significant-byte first.
In memory, the first byte of each instruction should be located at an even
addresses. If a program includes sprite data, it should be padded so any
instructions following it will be properly situated in RAM.

This document does not yet contain descriptions of the Super Chip-48
instructions. They are, however, listed below.

In these listings, the following variables are used (respect to instructions):

    nnn or addr - A 12-bit value, the lowest 12 bits
    n or nibble - A  4-bit value, the lowest 4 bits
    x           - A  4-bit value, the lower 4 bits of the high byte
    y           - A  4-bit value, the upper 4 bits of the low byte
    kk or byte  - An 8-bit value, the lowest 8 bits


3.1 - Standard Chip-8 Instructions
----------------------------------

0nnn - SYS addr
    Jump to a machine code routine at nnn.

    This instruction is only used on the old computers on which Chip-8 was
    originally implemented. It is ignored by modern interpreters.

00E0 - CLS
    Clear the display.

00EE - RET
    Return from a subroutine.

    The interpreter sets the program counter to the address at the top of
    the stack, then subtracts 1 from the stack pointer.

1nnn - JP addr
    Jump to location nnn.

    The interpreter sets the program counter to nnn.

2nnn - CALL addr
    Call subroutine at nnn.

    The interpreter increments the stack pointer, then puts the current
    PC on the top of the stack. The PC is then set to nnn.

3xkk - SE Vx, byte
    Skip next instruction if Vx = kk.

    The interpreter compares register Vx to kk, and if they are equal,
    increments the program counter by 2.

4xkk - SNE Vx, byte
    Skip next instruction if Vx != kk.

    The interpreter compares register Vx to kk, and if they are not equal,
    increments the program counter by 2.

5xy0 - SE Vx, Vy
    Skip next instruction if Vx = Vy.

    The interpreter compares register Vx to register Vy, and if they are
    equal, increments the program counter by 2.

6xkk - LD Vx, byte
    Set Vx = kk.

    The interpreter puts the value kk into register Vx.

7xkk - ADD Vx, byte
    Set Vx = Vx + kk.

    Adds the value kk to the value of register Vx, then stores the result in Vx.

8xy0 - LD Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vy.

    Stores the value of register Vy in register Vx.

8xy1 - OR Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vx OR Vy.

    Performs a bitwise OR on the values of Vx and Vy, then stores the
    result in Vx. A bitwise OR compares the corrseponding bits from two
    values, and if either bit is 1, then the same bit in the result is
    also 1. Otherwise, it is 0.

8xy2 - AND Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vx AND Vy.

    Performs a bitwise AND on the values of Vx and Vy, then stores the
    result in Vx. A bitwise AND compares the corrseponding bits from
    two values, and if both bits are 1, then the same bit in the result
    is also 1. Otherwise, it is 0.

8xy3 - XOR Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vx XOR Vy.

    Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on the values of Vx and Vy, then
    stores the result in Vx. An exclusive OR compares the corrseponding
    bits from two values, and if the bits are not both the same, then
    the corresponding bit in the result is set to 1. Otherwise, it is 0.

8xy4 - ADD Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vx + Vy, set VF = carry.

    The values of Vx and Vy are added together. If the result is greater
    than 8 bits (i.e., > 255,) VF is set to 1, otherwise 0. Only the
    lowest 8 bits of the result are kept, and stored in Vx.

8xy5 - SUB Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vx - Vy, set VF = NOT borrow.

    If Vx > Vy, then VF is set to 1, otherwise 0. Then Vy is subtracted
    from Vx, and the results stored in Vx.

8xy6 - SHR Vx {, Vy}
    Set Vx = Vx SHR 1.

    If the least-significant bit of Vx is 1, then VF is set to 1,
    otherwise 0. Then Vx is divided by 2.

8xy7 - SUBN Vx, Vy
    Set Vx = Vy - Vx, set VF = NOT borrow.

    If Vy > Vx, then VF is set to 1, otherwise 0. Then Vx is subtracted
    from Vy, and the results stored in Vx.

8xyE - SHL Vx {, Vy}
    Set Vx = Vx SHL 1.

    If the most-significant bit of Vx is 1, then VF is set to 1, otherwise
    to 0. Then Vx is multiplied by 2.

9xy0 - SNE Vx, Vy
    Skip next instruction if Vx != Vy.

    The values of Vx and Vy are compared, and if they are not equal,
    the program counter is increased by 2.

Annn - LD I, addr
    Set I = nnn.

    The value of register I is set to nnn.

Bnnn - JP V0, addr
    Jump to location nnn + V0.

    The program counter is set to nnn plus the value of V0.

Cxkk - RND Vx, byte
    Set Vx = random byte AND kk.

    The interpreter generates a random number from 0 to 255, which is
    then ANDed with the value kk. The results are stored in Vx. See
    instruction 8xy2 for more information on AND.

Dxyn - DRW Vx, Vy, nibble
    Display n-byte sprite starting at memory location I at (Vx, Vy),
    set VF = collision.

    The interpreter reads n bytes from memory, starting at the address
    stored in I. These bytes are then displayed as sprites on screen at
    coordinates (Vx, Vy). Sprites are XORed onto the existing screen.
    If this causes any pixels to be erased, VF is set to 1, otherwise
    it is set to 0. If the sprite is positioned so part of it is outside
    the coordinates of the display, it wraps around to the opposite side
    of the screen. See instruction 8xy3 for more information on XOR, and
    section 2.4, Display, for more information on the Chip-8 screen and
    sprites.

Ex9E - SKP Vx
    Skip next instruction if key with the value of Vx is pressed.

    Checks the keyboard, and if the key corresponding to the value of Vx
    is currently in the down position, PC is increased by 2.

ExA1 - SKNP Vx
    Skip next instruction if key with the value of Vx is not pressed.

    Checks the keyboard, and if the key corresponding to the value of
    Vx is currently in the up position, PC is increased by 2.

Fx07 - LD Vx, DT
    Set Vx = delay timer value.

    The value of DT is placed into Vx.

Fx0A - LD Vx, K
    Wait for a key press, store the value of the key in Vx.

    All execution stops until a key is pressed, then the value of that
    key is stored in Vx.

Fx15 - LD DT, Vx
    Set delay timer = Vx.

    DT is set equal to the value of Vx.

Fx18 - LD ST, Vx
    Set sound timer = Vx.

    ST is set equal to the value of Vx.

Fx1E - ADD I, Vx
    Set I = I + Vx.

    The values of I and Vx are added, and the results are stored in I.

Fx29 - LD F, Vx
    Set I = location of sprite for digit Vx.

    The value of I is set to the location for the hexadecimal sprite
    corresponding to the value of Vx. See section 2.4, Display, for
    more information on the Chip-8 hexadecimal font.

Fx33 - LD B, Vx
    Store BCD representation of Vx in memory locations I, I+1, and I+2.

    The interpreter takes the decimal value of Vx, and places the hundreds
    digit in memory at location in I, the tens digit at location I+1, and
    the ones digit at location I+2.

Fx55 - LD [I], Vx
    Store registers V0 through Vx in memory starting at location I.

    The interpreter copies the values of registers V0 through Vx into
    memory, starting at the address in I.

Fx65 - LD Vx, [I]
    Read registers V0 through Vx from memory starting at location I.

    The interpreter reads values from memory starting at location I
    into registers V0 through Vx.
